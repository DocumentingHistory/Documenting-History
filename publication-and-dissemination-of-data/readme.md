## Workshop (90 minutes)

**20 minutes**

Get into groups of 3-5. Pick one of the example of deposited historical data from the list below. Spend 15 minutes critiquing it (in light of what we've done today and the questions below), and prepare to report back briefly.

Resources:

- *Middlesex Convicts* http://sharonhoward.github.io/cdt/
- *Cupids vvhirligig As it hath bene sundry times acted by the Children of the Kings Majesties Reuels.* https://github.com/textcreationpartnership/A12074
- *The European State Finance Database* http://www.esfdb.org/Default.aspx
- *Derivative data for the Canadian Political Parties and Interest Groups collection* http://webarchives.ca/datasets

Questions:

- Is it clear what the data is?
- Do you think you'd be able to reuse the data easily? (think licence, format, description)
- Is it easy to give the depositor credit for their work?
- What does the deposit do well in your opinion?
- What could be improved?

**20 minutes**

Reporting back and general discussion.

**50 minutes**

Free time to do one (or all!) of the following, supported by us:
- If you have some data, add some documentation to it.
- If you have some data and some documentation, package and upload it somewhere.
- If you've made ‘data research plans’ on day one, work through those, map what you need to do into the plan based on this session.
